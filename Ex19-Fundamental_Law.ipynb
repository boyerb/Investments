        "Here we create a function `simulate_ir()`. We first simulate three \"blocks\" of numbers.  The number of rows in each block is `n_years`. Each row represents a different year. The number of columns of each block is a chose value for **breadth**, which represents both the number of signals we have, and the number of assets. We first simulate a blocks of signals. We then simulate a block of residuals with mean zero and volatility given by `sigma_z`.  Then using these signals, we create a block of abnormal returns, $a_{i,y}$ where the abnormla return for asset $i$ in year $y$ is   \n",

        "\\end{equation}\n",
        "Next, we create a block of active weights by scaling the signals by a scalar, $c$. Because the signals are mean zero, the active weights sum to approximately zero. Any small imbalance is absorbed by a position in the risk-free asset, which contributes neither abnormal return nor volatility. We then multiply each element in the block of abnormal returns by each weight element, and add these up across columns using `axis=1`. This gives us a column of abnormal returns for the fund portfolio in each year. Finally, we compute the information ratio. We estimate the expected abnormal return, or alpha, as the average portfolio abnormal return over all years. We estimate active risk as the standard deviation of the abnormal return.\n",
