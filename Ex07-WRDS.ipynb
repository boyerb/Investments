        "# Example Chapter 7: The WRDS API\n",
        "In this example we illustrate how to access CRSP data on equities using the WRDS API. The script uses the function `get_crsp_msf_by_ids` to download monthly data where `msf` stands for *monthly stock file*. A similar function, `get_crsp_dsf_by_ids`, allows you to access daily data where `dsf` stands for *daily stock file*. These functions are part of the `simple_finance` custom **module** that can be accessed from the course GitHub repo.  A module is a single Python file that contains functions, classes, or variables. By packaging code into well-designed functions, this module keeps our Python code clean, helps us avoid getting bogged down in less-important coding details, and maintains focus on core objectives. The complete code for this module can be seen at [`https://github.com/boyerb/Investments/blob/master/functions/simple_finance.py`](https://github.com/boyerb/Investments/blob/master/functions/simple_finance.py).\n",
