The variables $r_i$, $r_T$, and $z_i$ vary each period, while $r_f$ and $\\beta_i$ are constants. We begin this block by specifying the volatility of the idiosyncratic shocks, stored in the array variable `z_vol`.   The variance of these shocks, or volatility squared, represents the **idiosyncratic risk** of the firm's equity. The volatilities are chosen from a random uniform distribution from 0.05 to 0.15, and there are $N$ of them, one for each firm. The variance of $\\beta_ir_T$ represents the **systematic risk**.\n",

This container is a 2-dimensional Numpy Array, similar to a matrix, or block with rows and columns.  Python uses *zero-based indexing* rather than *one-based indexing*. This means that the first row or column of an array is `0` rather than `1`. This is somewhat counter-intuitive but has logical and practical reasons rooted in computer science.  If a block of data has `x` rows and `y` columns, then the rows are indexed as `0,1,2,...x-1`, and the columns are indexed as `0,1,2,...,y-1`.   \n",

Within this loop for stock $i$, the first thing we do is simulate an array of idiosyncratic shocks, one for each month. We assume idiosyncratic shocks are normally distributed and again use the `normal` function provided by the `random` NumPy module to simulate these shocks. The number of shocks is specified by `M` (one for each month), the mean is zero, and the standard deviation is given by the element of  `z_std_devs` for stock $i$, `z_std_devs[i]`. We then create an array of excess returns as in the equation above.  We multiply the array of tangent portfolio returns by the beta for stock $i$ amd then add to this the array of idiosyncratic shocks.  This produces a return array of length `M` and includes a return for each month. We store this array in the `excess_returns` container. The code `excess_returns[:, i]` implies how we will store this array in the container. The colon `:` implies we will use up all rows of the container, and `i` implies we will use the $i^{th}$ column. Hence the array of monthly returns for stock $i$ will be stored as column $i$ in the container `excess_returns`.   "

We create a NumPy array of ones of dimension $N$, and divide by $N$. Hence, all weights are simply $1/N$. The second option is to specify random portfolio weights betwen 0 and 1 that sum to one. We first create a random array of $N$ numbers using the `rand` function provided by the `random` module, and then we divide all of these by the sum so to create an array of weights that sums to one. The second option helps illustrate that the intuition gained from this example is not unique to equally-weighted portfolios. By default, Option #2 is commented out.    \n",

The array `excess_returns` is like an $M \\times N$ matrix and `weights` is like an $N \\times 1$ vector. The symbol `@` represents matrix multiplication. In this operation we take each row of `excess_returns`(the returns for all stocks for a given month) and take an inner product with weights.
