This container is a 2-dimensional Numpy Array, similar to a matrix, or block with rows and columns.  Python uses *zero-based indexing* rather than *one-based indexing*. This means that the first row or column of an array is `0` rather than `1`. This is somewhat counter-intuitive but has logical and practical reasons rooted in computer science.  If a block of data has `x` rows and `y` columns, then the rows are indexed as `0,1,2,...x-1`, and the columns are indexed as `0,1,2,...,y-1`.   \n",

The command \"`for i in range(N):`\" implies we will run the loop for every value of `i` from `0` to `N-1`, again because Python uses zero-based indexing. Within this loop for stock $i$, the first thing we do is simulate an array of idiosyncratic shocks, one for each month. We assume idiosyncratic shocks are normally distributed and again use the `normal` function provided by the `random` NumPy module to simulate these shocks. The number of shocks is specified by `M` (one for each month), the mean is zero, and the standard deviation is given by the element of  `z_vol` for stock $i$, `z_vol[i]`. We then create an array of excess returns as in the equation above.  We multiply the array of tangent portfolio returns by the beta for stock $i$ amd then add to this the array of idiosyncratic shocks.  This produces a return array of length `M` and includes a return for each month. We store this array in the `excess_returns` container. The code `excess_returns[:, i]` implies how we will store this array in the container. The colon `:` implies we will use up all rows of the container, and `i` implies we will use the $i^{th}$ column. Hence the array of monthly returns for stock $i$ will be stored as column $i$ in the container `excess_returns`.   "
